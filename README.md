# Stress Test of CPU Scheduling Algorithms
 This research will serve to compare existing scheduling algorithms together to determine which is the most effective 
under various circumstances. The algorithms in question will be First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), 
and Round Robin (RR). Each will be tested with varying number of jobs to complete, some of which will have an anbitrarily
large number of them, as well as including extreme outliers.
